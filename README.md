# IoCVideoLibrary
Inversion of Control example: a service for accessing videos from a repositories that uses dependency injections

**Advantages of DI construction:**
1. Decoupleing of Code from specific modules
    - Allows programming to an interface as opposed to an implementation of code
    - Creates flexibility to modify our dependencies without updating our entire service module
2. Testablility
    - Removes the need to mock-up / stub dependencies in testing 

## Key Features
- Can add view all video in our codebase
- Full test coverage of code

## Future features to add
1. Combatibility with other data structures such as functions
